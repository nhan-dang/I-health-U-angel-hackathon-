# Data

The data is located in `src/data` and is compiled by us.

-   [foods.json](./frontend/src/data/food.json) - contains all food nutrients
-   [nutrients.json](./frontend/src/data/nutrients.json) - contains the nutrients and RDI (Reference Daily Intake)

We wanted to keep it simple and may move to using the [USDA Food Database](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list) as a sort of API.
